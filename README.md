   You rate your **mood**, **sleep hours**, and **break time** using sliders.

2. **Burnout Risk Analysis** ğŸ“Š  
   Based on your input, the app checks if you're at **high** or **low** burnout risk.

3. **Self-Care Guidance** ğŸ’Œ  
   - If you're at **high risk**, it suggests 3 personalized self-care tips using the Gemini AI model.  
   - If you're at **low risk**, it gives you a positive affirmation to stay motivated.

4. **Built with LangGraph + Gemini API** ğŸ¤–  
   The app uses LangChainâ€™s LangGraph to structure this decision-making flow and only makes **one smart API call** to Gemini.
